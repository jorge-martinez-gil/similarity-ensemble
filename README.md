## Introduction
- **Scope**: The study investigates different **stacking strategies** used in semantic similarity measurement.
- **Relevance**: With the proliferation of semantic similarity techniques, stacking offers a way to **enhance accuracy** by combining multiple base estimators.
- **Applications**: Semantic similarity is crucial in **machine translation, search engines, text classification, and knowledge graph alignment**.

## Stacking Methods Explored
This work categorizes stacking methods into six distinct families:

### 1. **Algebraic Stacking**
   - *Description*: Employs basic statistical methods such as **mean, mode, and median** to aggregate semantic similarity scores.
   - *Pros*: Simple and computationally efficient.
   - *Cons*: Limited adaptability to complex data.

### 2. **Blending**
   - *Description*: Uses **regression models** to learn optimal weighting strategies for combining similarity scores.
   - *Pros*: Improves accuracy through supervised learning.
   - *Cons*: Sensitive to overfitting.

### 3. **Neural Stacking**
   - *Description*: Leverages **deep learning models** (e.g., MLPs, transformers) to refine similarity predictions.
   - *Pros*: Capable of capturing non-linear relationships.
   - *Cons*: Requires significant training data and computational power.

### 4. **Fuzzy Stacking**
   - *Description*: Applies **fuzzy logic** to handle uncertainty and imprecision in textual data.
   - *Pros*: Enhances interpretability and decision-making under uncertainty.
   - *Cons*: Parameter tuning can be complex.

### 5. **Genetic Stacking**
   - *Description*: Utilizes **evolutionary algorithms** to discover optimal stacking configurations.
   - *Pros*: Enables automated feature selection and adaptability.
   - *Cons*: Computationally expensive and may converge to local optima.

### 6. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - *Description*: Combines multiple stacking techniques (e.g., **Neurofuzzy Stacking, Neurosymbolic Stacking**) to optimize performance.
   - *Pros*: Balances accuracy and interpretability.
   - *Cons*: Complex to design and deploy.

## Discussion
- **Key Insights**: Stacking techniques significantly **outperform** individual similarity measures when properly configured.
- **Challenges**:
  - High computational requirements.
  - Model interpretability and transparency.
  - Sensitivity to input feature selection.
- **Impact**: These methods are increasingly integrated into **AI-driven applications**, particularly in **semantic search, knowledge graphs, and NLP pipelines**.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
- **Findings**: Stacking offers a powerful framework for improving **semantic similarity measurement**.
- **Open Problems**:
  - Scalability of stacking methods in real-world applications.
  - Strategies for reducing model training complexity.
  - New hybrid models combining traditional and deep learning approaches.
